# Flask Web App: A blogging website

This is a project where I am working on building a Blogging Website. This bloggin website is built on Flask and users can create accounts, add, delete and edit posts.
The website also includes email and password authentication for users, error handling and form validation.

### Run the following commands after cloning the project to test it out yourself:

- pip install Flask
- pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
- pip install flask-bcrypt
- pip install flask-login 
- pip install flask_wtf
- pip install Pillow
